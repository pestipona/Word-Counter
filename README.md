# Word Counter

## Counting word occurrence:

In this **program**, you'll need to start with a **given string** that contains a **number of words**. Then, define the **number of times each word appears** in the **given text**. After that point, you will see what the **top three words** used are.

The ```starter code``` already has some of this **functionality implemented**. Please **go through the code** in the ```wordcount.js``` file and **read the comments** to understand **how this logic** will work.

Your task is to **print to console** the **first three most common words** that **appear in a given text.**

### Notes:

* In the s```tarter code```, some comments start with the words **"TO DO."** This is where you could add your **lines of codes** to **solve this assignment**.

* The **words** will need to be **scrubbed** of any **punctuation**. To do so, you may choose to **use regex** and **"replace"**, or you may choose to get rid of any punctuation marks **another way**. It is up to you!

* **Watch out for casing**. The **JavaScript compiler** does not think a **lowercase** and an **uppercase letter** are the **same letter** the way humans do. To avoid this, **set the entire string** to be in **lowercase**.
