# Introduction To The Word Count Exercise:

Time to take a break for the **next coding challenge**! Last week, you learned **how to manipulate** and **display** salary data onscreen. Now, you're going to **take the next step** and learn how to **manipulate the values** of **string**. This exercise will help you **convert data** to **information**. After you're done, try it out with a **paragraph** from a **news article** or perhaps your **favorite book**. Enjoy!

In this video, **Professor John Williams** will introduce you to the **word count exercise**. You will **clean up a paragraph** so it is in **a form** that you can **manipulate**, so you can **count** the **most common words** in that **paragraph**.

n this exercise, we're going to **count words** in a **paragraph**. Now, we could go much larger than a **paragraph**. We could go to, for example, the **whole dictionary** of **English words**. But our goal here is for you to **count** the **number of times** each **word** appears in a **paragraph**.

Now, to do that, we're going to take advantage of a **special facility** in **objects**. So, in **objects**, we use **key value pairs**. All of **computation** is about having something with a ```name``` and a ```value```. So, ```x``` equals ```five```, say. Now, in an **object**, we have a **property**, and we can give the ```key``` to that **property**, and we can use the ```word```.

So, for example, we can **pick out any word** in the **paragraph**, and we can **create a property** with that ```word``` as the ```key```. Now, we will have the ```value``` as the **number of times** that it **appears** in the **paragraph**. So, you need to **loop over all the words** in the **paragraph**.

Much of your work is going to be **cleaning up the paragraph**. We need to **get rid** of ```spaces```. We need to **get rid** of ```full stops```. We need to **get rid** of ```punctuation``` in general. So, you **clean up the paragraph**, get it into **a form** that you can **manipulate**, and then *run through it* and **put every word** into what we might call a ```dictionary```. It's like a **HashMap**. Other languages call it **HashMaps**, but in ```JavaScript```, it's a basic ```object```.
